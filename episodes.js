      "desc":"Taking a look around, it is easy to see examples of self deception practiced by others. Unconciously, of course. But if it truly is so common, each of us must have our faults with it as well? But how can we know, how can we find out? Yuta and Henry work at a definition of self-deception and explore its epistemic ramifications.",

      "name":"What is Religion?",
      "desc":"A dive into seemingly straightforward question with a religious studies major at Reed College. The conversation starts off by considering the percieved differences between religions in Europe and religions in eastern Asia. However though trying to refine this question, we develop a much larger perspective about religions in general, and also how such a simplistic comparison doesn't yield what truly makes religions interesting.",

Then we explore the differences in college life between the large public University of California Berkeley and a small private Reed College.",

      "name":"Immigration Policy for the United States",
      "desc":"Yuta and Henry duel it out over immigration policy for the US. On one side is the disconcerted nationalist, supporting larger restrictions on immigration and priority for the recognized citizens of a country when push comes to shove. This side also considers the culture of one's country inherently valuable and worth protecting politically. On the other side is the more economically-focussed perspective that sees the overwhelming academic consensus that freer markets and freer immigration leads to a better quality of life for everyone involved, in the long term.",

We have on a guest to help us point out the flaws in social media, our personal gripes with it, but also its innovative features.",

      "desc":"Yuta and Henry duel it out over what types of video games are truly <i>art</i>. Perhaps the aspects of video games that resemble more-entrenched forms of art like novels, movies, and the visual arts make the new medium worthy of <i>art</i>, but it brings nothing fundamentally new to the table. Or perhaps the interaction and game-mechanical aspects of video games are actually a new dimension to artistic expression not derivative of the more-entrenched art forms.",
